This is a fork of [https://github.com/ashpynov/PlayniteSound](https://github.com/ashpynov/PlayniteSound), which is also a fork of the original [https://github.com/joyrider3774/PlayniteSound](https://github.com/joyrider3774/PlayniteSound).

The original project was abandoned and the PlayniteSoundMod fork has very slow development and no responses on issues. This fork is an attempt to solve most common bugs and keep the extension usable until Playnite 11 comes along.

## What it does

Playnite Sounds is an extension to play audio files during Playnite events. It supports WAV audio files and MP3 for music.
