# Playnite Sounds Extension

This is a fork of [https://github.com/ashpynov/PlayniteSound](https://github.com/ashpynov/PlayniteSound), which is also a fork of the original [https://github.com/joyrider3774/PlayniteSound](https://github.com/joyrider3774/PlayniteSound).

The original project was abandoned and the PlayniteSoundMod fork has very slow development and no responses on issues. This fork is an attempt to solve most common bugs and keep the extension usable until Playnite 11 comes along.
